I created all HTML elements using DOM. For generating cards for all the rest counties. 
I used for-loop upto the array length as its condition. 
Then Written two async functions for generating country reports and their weather reports(click event).
ANd finally appended into the body with setting a timer for each card[setTimeout(country_report,1000)].
